            <p class="problemparagraph">Exploring cities with the tools available today presents its fair share of
                challenges.<br>While modern technology has undoubtedly made exploration more accessible, reliance on
                digital maps and GPS can lead to an over-reliance on screens, causing us to miss out on the subtle
                nuances and hidden gems that cities have to offer.</p>

            <h2 class="Background">Background</h2>
            <p>The background for an AR exploration app involves recognizing the growing popularity and potential of AR
                technology. AR has opened up exciting possibilities for creating interactive and immersive experiences,
                enhancing how people explore and interact with the world around them.<br>Traditional exploration apps
                and travel guides have limitations in providing a truly engaging and captivating experience.<br>The idea
                of developing an AR exploration app emerges to bridge this gap and
                revolutionize how people discover and learn about different locations, historical sites, landmarks &
                cultural points of interest.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>Through user research, we aimed to understand the user's preferences, behaviours and pain points

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>After creating a Proto-Persona, our team brainstormed and came up with 5 Research Questions for our
                project, from which we were able to devise an interview script and survey questions.<br>In order to
                collect Quantitative Data, we conducted a survey online.<br>Then, in order to collect Qualitative Data,
                we conducted User Interviews with Six participants.</p>

                dwelling into the realm of augmented reality, we wanted to make sure our potential user's had a basic
                understanding of what augmented reality is and how it's functions can be used in everyday life.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>“I would probably want it to be very easy and straightforward just because AR sounds like
                    it would
                    be a pretty intense concept visually.”</li>
                <li>“Thats exactly how I envisioned it with like the information overlay…I think you would feel not
                    only submerged with your surroundings but also like being in there.”</li>
                <li>“So for instance, I'm thinking about, say I go to Rome and I look at a historical monument, I don't
                    know what it is, but if I hover my phone over it, it gives me a description of what it is, um, you
                    know, like when was it made, what's the historical significance of it, and it also outlays a path
                    for me to another year".</li>

            <p>Urban explorers and travelers who seek authentic and immersive city experiences encounter challenges in
                exploring unfamiliar locations that provide personalized and relevant information.<br>Existing solutions
                lack the integration of organic discovery with modern technology, leading to less than ideal exploration
                experiences.<br>How might we alleviate the struggles of urban explorers and travelers seeking authentic

        <div class="Userinsights">
            <h2>User Insights</h2>
            <p>During our user research (surveys & interviews), we discovered when exploring a city, users want to find
                information based on their personal preferences but often are unable to do so as the internet often
                caters
                to mainstream audiences by providing generalized lists of activities rather than tailoring suggestions
                to
                individual interests.<br>Therefore, we believe that unless a user does an extensive deep dive into the
                obscure corners of the internet, they’re unable to find activities that cater to their desires. We might
                be
                able to help if we create a way for users to explore their cities in an organic way whilst also being
                given
                suggestions based on their interests.</p>

                outlined our goals, insights, features and challenges related to our project and used this as a

                the user would be able to use the application.<br>The user flow allowed us to look at how we would
                design the onboarding process, signing up, and how we would create the augmented reality overlays
